# BNPL Data Warehouse & Analytics Dashboard

Hands-on implementation and analysis of a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) data pipeline based on an open-source reference project. The focus of this project is understanding data ingestion, transformation, and storage workflows rather than building a production system.


## Project Overview

This project is a scaled-down version of an enterprise data warehouse, implementing a medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold) using modern data engineering tools and principles. The system integrates data from multiple sources, transforms it through a dimensional model, and creates business-ready analytics for various stakeholders.

The goal of this project is to build an analytical solution for a BNPL company, enabling the business to better understand and analyse customer transactions, payment plans, and merchant activities.

## Features

- **Medallion Architecture**: Bronze (raw data), Silver (dimensional model), Gold (business models)
- **ETL Pipelines**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading processes
- **dbt Transformations**: Modular, testable data transformations
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Star schema implementation with facts and dimensions
- **Business Analytics**: Ready-to-use analytics models for key business domains
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of key business metrics
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanation of design decisions and implementation details

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data processing and scripting
- **PostgreSQL**: Source system simulation for storing transactional data
- **DuckDB**: Analytical database for high-performance querying
- **dbt**: Data transformation framework for building, testing, and maintaining the data models
- **Streamlit**: Dashboard creation for visualizing data insights
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation for cleaning and transforming datasets
- **Plotly**: Data visualization for generating interactive charts and graphs

### Why These Technologies?

- **Python** is widely used in data engineering for automation and scripting, making it an ideal choice for this project.
- **PostgreSQL** is used as the simulated source database for transactional data due to its robustness and flexibility.
- **DuckDB** was chosen for its speed in analytical workloads, making it ideal for performing queries on large datasets.
- **dbt** helps ensure clean and testable data transformations, allowing for modular data pipeline development.
- **Streamlit** simplifies the process of creating interactive dashboards, making it easy to visualize business metrics.

## Key Features

### Data Pipeline

- **Raw Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested from CSV files simulating BNPL transactions and customer details.
- **Data Transformation**: Data is transformed using dbt models to create dimensional models and business-level analytics.
- **Incremental Loading**: Data processing is optimized by only processing new records in incremental batches.
- **Data Quality**: Data validation checks are included to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data.

### ETL Process

The data pipeline performs the following steps:
1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from source systems (simulated by CSV files).
2. **Loading**: Data is loaded into the bronze layer, representing raw, untransformed data.
3. **Transformation**: The silver layer contains transformed data, organized using dimensional models like star schemas.
4. **Business Models**: The gold layer consists of analytical models ready for business users, providing key insights.
5. **Dashboard Exposure**: Data is exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.

### Data Quality

This implementation includes several data quality checks:
- **Null and Consistency Checks**: Ensuring there are no missing or inconsistent values in the data.
- **Referential Integrity**: Ensuring that relationships between tables (e.g., between transactions and customers) are maintained.
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Checking that data conforms to predefined business rules.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying anomalous or extreme values that could indicate errors.

## Data Model

### Bronze Layer

Raw Data: Ingested from source systems (simulated CSV files)

- `customers`: Customer information
- `merchants`: Merchant details
- `transactions`: Transaction data
- `payment_plans`: Details of payment plans
- `installments`: Installment records
- `user_events`: Events from user interactions with the platform

### Silver Layer (Dimensional Model)

#### Dimensions:
- `dim_customers`: Information about customers
- `dim_merchants`: Information about merchants
- `dim_dates`: Time dimension for analysis

#### Facts:
- `fact_transactions`: Transaction records
- `fact_payment_plans`: Payment plan data
- `fact_customer_events`: Data about customer interactions

### Gold Layer (Business Models)

- `gold_customer_analytics`: Insights into customer behavior
- `gold_merchant_analytics`: Insights into merchant performance
- `gold_transaction_analytics`: Insights into transaction patterns
- `gold_payment_analytics`: Insights into payment plan performance

## Data Lineage

### Key Analytics:

- **Transaction Analytics**: Volume, trends, and merchant performance
- **Customer Analytics**: Segmentation, behavior, and value
- **Merchant Analytics**: Performance, categories, and activity
- **Payment Plan Analytics**: Default rates, installments, and merchant risk
